## Monthly Challenges for 2022 ##
Monthly challenge is my personal broad monthly goals for 2022 built using Django Python Framework. I am building this app to practice while learning Django Framework. 
I plan to learn React in 2022 and use it to make it's Front End.
The READMe will be updated along as I get more ideas on how to make the app more interactive and useful.

This app is inspired by the <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/python-django-the-practical-guide/learn">Academind by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller Udacity Python Django Tutorials </a>.
